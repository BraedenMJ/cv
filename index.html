        <p><em>Marketing Guru, Developer in training</p></em>

        <p>The point at which creative marketing and analytics meet is where I thrive, and I love diving into strategy and using the right tools to measure results. I'm obsessed with learning and sitting in the discomfort of doing hard things in
          service of growth.

          My core competency is a synthesis of technical marketing and strategy, as evidenced by the multiple industry certifications I currently hold, including Hubspot Inbound Marketing, Google Ads, Analytics and a few others.

          I am also currently developing my front-end skills and I love the intersection of web development and marketing as it relates to CRO and understanding the user-journey. I live by the notion of "if you can't test it, it's not worth
          considering."

          If you can't find me diving head-first into data, I'm probably lifting something, learning something or drinking an espresso. I might also be writing a blog over at Striveculture.com.
